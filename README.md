# LLMDog üê∂

**LLMDog** is a developer-friendly command-line tool that simplifies sharing your code with Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude, ChatGPT, and others. It allows you to intelligently select files and directories from your project, automatically formats them with proper Markdown, and copies the output directly to your clipboard‚Äîready to paste into any LLM chat interface.

- **Consistent Formatting**: Ensures your code is properly formatted in Markdown, with syntax highlighting based on file extensions.
- **Context Preservation**: Includes a directory tree to help LLMs understand your project structure.
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with no setup required.
